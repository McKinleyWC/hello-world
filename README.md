My first repository.

Hello!

I'm currently in school for IT/Software Dev. I've learned some Java, HTML 5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Next I'll be learning C/C++. I'm 30, and a new dad, and it's great! Looking to add to my skillset and portfolio so I can get a job and finally get out of my dead end "career".
